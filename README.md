# Digicape / iStore / Takealot Apple Price Tracker

A live-updating price comparison for Apple products across three South African
retailers — Digicape, iStore, and Takealot — built as a static dashboard backed
by a scheduled GitHub Actions scraper.

## How it works

1. `.github/workflows/update-prices.yml` runs on a schedule (every 6 hours,
   plus a manual "Run workflow" button in the Actions tab) and executes the
   three scraper scripts in `scripts/`.
2. Each scraper writes its retailer's results to `data/<retailer>.json`.
3. `scripts/combine.py` merges the three files into `data/prices.json`,
   fuzzy-matching the same product across retailers so the dashboard can show
   a side-by-side comparison. Matching is heuristic — see the docstring at the
   top of that script for known limitations (iPhone/Watch SKU names vary the
   most between retailers).
4. The workflow commits `data/prices.json` back to the repo.
5. `docs/index.html` (the dashboard) fetches that file directly from
   `raw.githubusercontent.com` every time it's opened, so it always shows
   the latest committed data. If the fetch fails — for example before the
   workflow has ever run — it falls back to a snapshot baked into the page
   at build time.

## Viewing the dashboard

Turn on GitHub Pages for this repo (Settings → Pages → Deploy from a branch →
`main` / `/docs`) and it will be served at
`https://cd5wtsnct4-bot.github.io/digicape/`. Until Pages is enabled, you can
still open `docs/index.html` directly — the live fetch works from any origin
because `raw.githubusercontent.com` sends permissive CORS headers.

## Running a scraper manually

Each script in `scripts/` can be run locally:

```bash
pip install "scrapling[all]>=0.4.14"
scrapling install --force
python scripts/digicape_prices.py
python scripts/istore_prices.py
python scripts/takealot_apple_prices.py
python scripts/combine.py
```

## Known limitations

- Product-name matching across retailers is heuristic, not exact. Some
  identical products may show up as separate unmatched cards; occasionally
  two different configurations may merge into one row. Spot-check
  `data/prices.json` after a run.
- Accessories and Apple TV catalogs are large and only partially represented.
- Retailer HTML structure changes over time — if a scraper starts returning
  zero results, the CSS selectors at the top of that script need updating
  (each script has a `--dump-html` flag to help re-calibrate them).
